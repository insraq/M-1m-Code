# M+ 1m font for code.

The wonderful [M+ 1m](http://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp/) font with subset for coding only.

The original M+ 1m font comes with Japanese Kanji glyph.
So CJK characters will be displayed using the built-in glyph, which is not always preferred.
These TTFs are subset of M+ 1m font which only contains characters and symbols for coding.
CJK characters will fallback to system font.
